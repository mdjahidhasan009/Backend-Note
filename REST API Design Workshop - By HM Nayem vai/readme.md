# Project Proposal

**Project Name**: ECommerce Solution  
**Mission**: Create a digital presence of our company

## Problem Statement
The Z company sells shoes offline. Now they want to create an online store and build a D2C brand. They need web and 
mobile applications for the end user, an admin dashboard, and CMS for administration purposes.

## Functional Requirements
- **Product Catalog**: The product catalog feature will enable users to browse through a comprehensive list of items 
  available for purchase within the system.
- **Multiple Categories**: The multiple categories functionality will organize products into distinct categories and 
  subcategories based on their attributes, characteristics, or types.
- **Instant Search**: Instant search functionality will provide users with real-time search results as they type their 
  query into the search bar. It will quickly retrieve relevant products based on their names, descriptions, or 
  attributes, displaying matching results dynamically.
- **Shopping Cart**: The shopping cart feature will allow users to add selected items to their virtual cart for
  subsequent purchase. Users can review the contents of their cart, modify quantities, or remove items as needed before
  proceeding to checkout.
- **Digital Payments**: Digital payments functionality will enable users to complete transactions securely and
  conveniently using electronic payment methods. It will support various payment options such as credit cards, debit 
  cards, mobile wallets, or online payment gateways.

## Deliverables
A Scalable REST API


# API
The API is a contract between the client and the server. It defines how the client can interact with the server. The API
is a set of rules that the client must follow to communicate with the server. The API specifies the endpoints, methods,
parameters, and responses that the client can use to interact with the server. The API is a bridge between the 
client(consumer) and the server(provider), allowing them to communicate with each other. Sometime, we use that API to
communicate between two different services and clients.

- Provider: The server that provides the API.
- Consumer: The client that consumes the API.

# API Architectural Styles

## What is API Design?

## Why Designing API is Important?

### Interoperability
Well-designed APIs define clear contracts and standards for data exchange, enabling interoperability between diverse
platforms, programming languages, and technologies.

### Abstraction
APIs abstract the underlying complexities of software components, exposing only the necessary functionality and data to 
consumers.

### Reusability
Developers can leverage existing APIs to access common functionalities such as authentication, data storage, or payment
processing, rather than reinventing the wheel.

### Adaptability
Well-designed APIs are flexible and adaptable, allowing them to evolve over time in response to changing requirements, 
technologies, and business needs.

### Developer Experience
Well-designed APIs are intuitive, consistent, and well-documented, making it easier for developers to understand, 
integrate, and use the provided functionality.

### Security & Reliability
APIs should incorporate security best practices. Well-designed APIs also handle errors gracefully and provide
informative error messages.
