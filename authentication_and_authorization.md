## Authentication
* Robust password storage using bcrypt(or similar algorithms) with a unique salt for hashing.
* Secure password reset mechanism with a time-limited token.
* Use JWT(JSON Web Tokens) for session management.

## Authorization
* Role-based access control(RBAC) to restrict access to certain parts of the application.
* Implement fine-grained access control to restrict access to specific resources.

## Secure Cookies
* use httpOnly and secure flags for cookies to prevent XSS attacks and to enforce HTTPS.
* Short session expiration time to reduce the risk of session hijacking.
* Use SameSite attribute to prevent CSRF attacks.
* Consider a dedicated library for session management like express-session.
