## Tools
### Snyk
* Snyk is a tool that helps you find and fix known vulnerabilities in your dependencies.
* It can be used to scan your dependencies for vulnerabilities and to monitor them for new vulnerabilities.
* Snyk can be integrated into your CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan your dependencies for vulnerabilities.
* Snyk can also be used to monitor your dependencies for new vulnerabilities and to automatically create pull requests 
  to update your dependencies.

### Security Linter and SAST(Security Static Analysis Tool)
* Security linters and SAST tools are tools that help you find security vulnerabilities in your code.
* They can be used to scan your code for security vulnerabilities and to provide you with recommendations on how to fix 
  them.
* Security linters and SAST tools can be integrated into your CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan your code for 
  security vulnerabilities.

## Secure Connection and Content Protection
* **HTTPS/TLS**: Enforce encryption of data in all production traffic.
* **CSP(Content Security Policy)**: Protect your application from XSS attacks by defining a whitelist of trusted sources 
  for content.
* **HSTS(HTTP Strict Transport Security)**: Enforce the use of HTTPS by instructing browsers to always use HTTPS for 
  your domain.
* **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevent browsers from MIME-sniffing a response away from the declared content-type.
* **CSRF Protection**: Protect your application from CSRF attacks by using CSRF tokens.

## Input Validation and Sanitization
* **Input Validation**: Validate all input data to ensure it meets the expected format and length. **Never trust user 
  input**.
* **Sanitization**: Sanitize all input data to prevent XSS attacks and other injection attacks(XSS, SQL Injection,
  command injection, code injection, etc.).
* **Limit Request Size**: Limit the size of incoming requests to prevent DoS attacks.
* **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks and DoS attacks.
* **CORS Configuration**: Configure CORS to prevent unauthorized access to your resources.
* **Content-Type Checking**: Check the content-type of incoming requests to prevent attacks like CSRF and XSS.
* **File Upload Security**: Secure file uploads by validating file types, limiting file sizes, and storing files 
  securely.
* **HTTP Security Headers**: Use security headers like X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, and X-Content-Type-Options to 
  protect your application from common attacks.
* **Session Management**: Implement secure session management to prevent session hijacking and fixation attacks.
* **Password Security**: Store passwords securely using strong hashing algorithms like bcrypt and enforce password 
  complexity requirements.
* **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling to prevent information leakage and to provide a good user 
  experience.


## Vigilance, Error Handling and Advance Protection
* **Logging and Monitoring**: Log all security-related events and monitor your application for suspicious activity.
* **Brute Force Protection**: Implement brute force protection to prevent brute force attacks on your application.
* **ReDoS Awareness**: Be aware of Regular Expression Denial of Service(ReDoS) attacks and prevent them by limiting the 
  complexity of regular expressions.
* Safe Error Handling: Implement safe error handling to prevent information leakage and to provide a good user
  experience.
* **OWASP Top 10**: Be aware of the OWASP Top 10 security risks and take steps to mitigate them in your application.


# Understanding the OWASP Top 10
- **OWASP**: The Open Web Application Security ProjectÂ®, a global non-profit focused on improving web security.
- **OWASP Top 10**: Flagship OWASP project - a regularly updated list of the most critical web application security 
  risks.
- **Best Practices vs. Evolving Threats**: Security best practices provide a strong foundation, but attackers constantly 
  adapt their techniques.
- **Real-World Focus**: The OWASP Top 10 highlights vulnerabilities actively exploited by attackers.
- **Proactive Defense**: Addressing the OWASP Top 10 proactively strengthens your Node.js applications against
  real-world attacks.

## A01: Broken Access Control

- **Description**: Failure to enforce proper restrictions on what authenticated users can do, allowing them to access 
  unauthorized data or functions.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Authorization
  - Secure Cookies
  - Input Validation.

## A02: Cryptographic Failures

- **Description**: Weak or outdated encryption algorithms, improper key management, and other cryptographic flaws that
  expose sensitive data.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Authentication (includes robust password storage)
  - HTTPS/TLS

## A03: Injection

- **Description**: Untrusted data sent as part of a command or query leads to unintended code execution (e.g., SQL
  injection, XSS).
- **Best Practices**:
  - Input Validation
  - Sanitization

## A04: Insecure Design

- **Description**: Security risks not adequately considered from the initial design stages, leading to architectural
  weaknesses.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Staying Informed (OWASP resources help design with security in mind)

## A05: Security Misconfiguration

- **Description**: Default configurations, unpatched systems, unnecessary open ports/services, verbose error messages
  expose vulnerabilities.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Keeping Up-to-Date
  - Safe Error Handling
  - Secure Cookies
