# REST
REST stands for **Representational State Transfer**. It is a software architectural style that defines a set of 
constraints to be used for creating Web services. 

* **RESTful Web Services:** Web services that conform to the REST architectural style, or 
RESTful web services, provide interoperability between computer systems on the Internet. 
  * Allow the requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of Web resources by using a uniform and 
    predefined set of stateless operations.

Other kinds of web services, such as SOAP web services, expose their own arbitrary sets of operations.
